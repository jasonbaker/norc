# Norc task management, runnable from the cmd line
#
# Currently, if a scheduled task is not run on time, 
# it will not catch up.  This behavior is the same as crontab:
# If the host is turned off when a job should run, it never runs.
#
# Norc can be used as a queue service for tasks. 
# The following patterns allow this behavior:
#  - Tasks are always executed on a FIFO basis *for that task implementation*, 
#    from when they were added to TMS (using the 'date_added' column).
#  - If is_ephemeral is True, the task will be 
#    marked as 'expired' after being run exactly one time.
#    This is regardless of success or failure, and a task 
#    that is retried after failure doesn't lose its position in the queue
#
# TODO Missing basics:
# - Tasks need unique names -- is that true??
# - Tasks should be assigned permissions, runtime environments
#
# TODO Jobs:
# - A Task that is a SchedulableTask needs to have BOTH its predecessors successfully completed and it's run time occur.
#   - The Job can decide whether a SchedulableTask that has missed a run time is to be 
#     caught up fully, latest, or waits its next run time. (see --catch_up option)
# TODO There should be an option to 'catch up' on tasks that should have run but didn't:
#  "--catch_up ALL" to run() all missed occurances of all Tasks that should have run but didn't.
#  "--catch_up LATEST" to run() one occurance of all Tasks that should have run bud didn't.
#
# TODO Need global resources: resources shared across all regions
# TODO dynamic resources, like hitting a URL
# TODO delay between resource usages
# TODO Need ability to retry Tasks, N times before failing, and with min delay between attempts
# TODO Input/Output Job definitions to XML; it's a config, after all.
